                "description": "A range is a versatile kitchen appliance that combines a cooktop and an oven in a single unit, offering comprehensive cooking capabilities. It is particularly good for a wide variety of cooking tasks, from stovetop simmering, boiling, sautéing, and frying to baking, roasting, and broiling in the oven. The cooktop can feature gas, electric, or induction burners, each providing different levels of heat control and efficiency. The oven portion allows for baking and roasting, making a range ideal for preparing complete meals. Its multifunctionality makes it a central component of most kitchens, catering to diverse cooking needs."

                "description": "A rangetop differs from a range in that it is solely the cooktop portion without an integrated oven. It is typically installed into a countertop or island and offers the same functionality as the cooktop on a range, with burners for tasks like boiling, simmering, sautéing, and frying. Rangetops are often favored in kitchens where a separate wall oven is installed, allowing for greater flexibility in kitchen design. They can provide a professional look and often come with high-end features, like precise temperature controls and specialized burners. In contrast, a range combines both the cooktop and oven in one unit, offering a complete cooking solution in a single appliance."

A range is a cooking appliance that combines a cooktop and an oven, allowing you to perform a variety of cooking tasks such as boiling, frying, baking, and roasting. It is the central unit where food preparation and cooking occur. In contrast, a rangehood is a ventilation device installed above the cooktop or range. Its purpose is to remove smoke, steam, grease, odors, and heat generated during cooking. By using a fan, it either vents the air outside or filters and recirculates it back into the kitchen. In summary, a range is used for cooking, while a rangehood is used for ventilation, ensuring a cleaner and more comfortable cooking environment."
